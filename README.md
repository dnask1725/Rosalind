Learning bioinformatics usually requires solving computational problems of varying difficulty that are extracted from real challenges of molecular biology.
To make learning bioinformatics fun and easy, Rosalind, a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem solving.
Rosalind is a joint project between the University of California at San Diego and Saint Petersburg Academic University along with the Russian Academy of Sciences. Rosalind is partly funded by a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor Award and a Russian Megagrant Award received by Pavel Pevzner.
The problems are categorised in 5, with each problem interlinked with few basic concepts. The categories are:
1. Python Village
2. Bioinformatics Stronghold
3. Bioinformatics Armory
4. Bioinformatics TextBook Track
5. Algorithmic heights
